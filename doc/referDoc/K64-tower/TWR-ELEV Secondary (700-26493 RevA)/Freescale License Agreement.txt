FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is a legal agreement between you (either as an individual or as an authorized representative of your employer) and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. ("Freescale"). It concerns your rights to use this file and any accompanying written materials (the "Software"). In consideration for Freescale allowing you to access the Software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not download the Software. If you change your mind later, stop using the Software and delete all copies of the Software in your possession or control. Any copies of the Software that you have already distributed, where permitted, and do not destroy will continue to be governed by this Agreement. Your prior use will also continue to be governed by this Agreement. 

LICENSE GRANT.  The Software may contain two types of programs: (i) programs enabling you to design a system, including without limitation schematics, gerber files, manufacturing data and bill of materials (“System Designs”), and (ii) programs that could be executed on your designed system (“System Software”). Your rights in these distinct programs differ. With respect to System Designs, Freescale grants to you, free of charge, the non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use, reproduce, and prepare derivative works of the System Designs for the sole purpose of designing systems that contain a programmable processing unit obtained directly or indirectly from Freescale (“Freescale System”). You may not distribute or sublicense the System Designs to others; however, you may sell Freescale Systems designed using the System Design. Freescale does not grant to you any rights under its patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, or import systems designed using the System Designs. That is beyond the scope of this Agreement. With respect to System Software, Freescale grants to you, free of charge, the non-exclusive, non-ttransferable right to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of the System Software, distribute the System Software and derivative works thereof in object (machine–readable) form only, and to sublicense to others the right to use the distributed System Software exclusively with Freescale Systems. You must prohibit your sublicensees from translating, reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling the System Software except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits such restriction. If you violate any of the terms or restrictions of this Agreement, Freescale may immediately terminate this Agreement, and require that you stop using and delete all copies of the Software in your possession or control. You are solely responsible for systems you design using the Software. 

COPYRIGHT.  The Software is licensed to you, not sold. Freescale owns the Software, and United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions protect the Software. Therefore, you must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material (e.g. a book or musical recording). You may not use or copy the Software for any other purpose than what is described in this Agreement. Except as expressly provided herein, Freescale does not grant to you any express or implied rights under any Freescale or third-party patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets. Additionally, you must reproduce and apply any copyright or other proprietary rights notices included on or embedded in the Software to any copies or derivative works made thereof, in whole or in part, if any.

PRODUCT LABELING.  You are not authorized to use any Freescale trademarks, brand names, or logos. 

ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Freescale regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior communications, negotiations, understandings, agreements or representations, either written or oral, if any. This Agreement may only be amended in written form, executed by you and Freescale. 

SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a modification or replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or Freescale of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision. 

NO WAIVER.  The waiver by Freescale of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent breach of the same or a different provision.
